- Still need 3 more images for work sections.

- Just realized I should have made a transparent GIF (if that is still a thing) to use for the links on each Work section because I used background images. That or can I wrap a div with A link?

- Then hopefully I can add the hover effect with Gradient fade over the background image.

I will have to get back to this tomorrow... Including writing an actual ReadMe to explain what I did or tried to do.
